# Insurance_Policy_Onboarding_Automation
This project automates the end-to-end onboarding process of new insurance policyholders using AI, OCR, and NLP technologies ‚Äî eliminating manual data entry and verification delays.



‚öôÔ∏è How It Works:

Document Upload:
Customers upload KYC documents (Aadhaar, PAN, policy forms, etc.).

OCR Extraction:
The system extracts unstructured text from scanned documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

NLP-based Data Structuring:
NLP models parse and organize key fields ‚Äî like Name, Address, ID Number, Date of Birth, etc. ‚Äî into a structured format.

Validation & Cross-checking:
The extracted details are automatically verified against databases or policy application forms to ensure consistency.

Policy Generation:
Once validated, the system auto-fills forms, generates policy documents, and triggers approval workflows.



üß† Tech Stack:

Python, Pandas, Faker (for synthetic data)

OCR: Tesseract / EasyOCR

NLP: spaCy / Regex-based extraction

Automation: Flask / Streamlit for UI integration



üéØ Outcome:

Reduced manual data entry by 80‚Äì90%

Faster and error-free policy onboarding

Scalable pipeline for fraud detection and data validation
